Exploring robotics at the  University of Fribourg, merging theory with practical application (Python on GCtronics E-Puck)

This document explains simple movement patterns of Braitenberg vehicles, implemented
implemented with the E-Puck from GCtronic. In addition to simple forward and backward movements,
and backward movements, different variations of Braitenberg vehicles are discussed, with special
particular focus on the state transitions, as well as the calibration of the sensors and the motor speed.
