Exploring robotics with [GCtronics E-Puck](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mobots/robots-technologies/e-puck2).
The E-Puck was designed at the EPFL Autonomous Systems Lab and is open-hardware and its software open-source.

## Braitenberg vehicle - Lover version ##

See [Braitenberg vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle) for a short introduction.

### Approaching obstacles ###

The Braitenberg vehicle in the Lover version is designed to approach an obstacle it has spotted.

Learnings:

```
proxR = ( a * prox_values [0] + b * prox_values [1] + c * prox_values [2] + d * prox_values [3]) / ( a + b + c + d )
proxL = ( a * prox_values [7] + b * prox_values [6] + c * prox_values [5] + d * prox_values [4]) / ( a + b + c + d )
dsR = ( NORM_SPEED * proxR ) / MAX_PROX
dsL = ( NORM_SPEED * proxL ) / MAX_PROX
speedR = ( NORM_SPEED - dsR )
speedL = ( NORM_SPEED - dsL )
```
